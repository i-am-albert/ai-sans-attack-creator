# Sans Attack Generator

A tool that generates custom attack patterns for the [Bad Time Simulator](https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/).

## How to Use

1. Go to https://i-am-albert.github.io/ai-sans/
2. Enter a prompt describing the attack you want to create
3. Click "Generate Attack"
4. Click "Download Attack"
5. Use the output in the Bad Time Simulator:
   - Go to https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/
   - Select "Custom attack"
   - Select "Load file"
   - Select the .csv generated by the tool
   - Go back (X) and select "Run attack"

## TODO

- Make prompt better so the model understands the environment better
- Blue-red mode switching still doesn't work


This tool uses the OpenRouter API with Gemini Pro to generate attack patterns compatible with jcw87's Bad Time Simulator.
Yes, I know my api key is exposed in the code, but I don't care.
